## Client Side Chat Application ##

This project was created in two parts, the other part being found at https://github.com/TREAustin/sserver-side-chat-application.  
This application allows users to open a client console window, listen for UDP connections send the server broadcast address, connect to a server through a TCP 
connection, send messages to other users on the same server and interact with the server. 

### UDP Connection ###

For the client side, the UDP connection is simple.  The ClientUPD.h file only needs to recieve the server IP address to connect to.  Once the server IP address has been
recieved, the UDP portion is done.

```

```

### TCP Connection ###



### Threading ###

### Winsock ###
